In this lab, I started with Breadth First Search algorithm. But I realized that it is not efficient for larger spaces and not able to solve 4x4 puzzles in reasonable time. 
Later on I applied A* algorithm with manhattan distance and priority queue for finding 4x4 puzzle. It did not find solution with 100_000 randomized steps in 400+ mins so I decreased it to 150.

for 3x3 puzzle in bfs:
solution were found in 18 steps and 24375 cases were evaluated.

for 4x4 puzzle in a*:
solution were found in 34 steps and 101043 cases were evaluated.
